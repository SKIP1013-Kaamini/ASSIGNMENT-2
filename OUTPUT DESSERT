A tart is a baked dish consisting of a filling over a pastry base with an open top not covered with pastry. 
The pastry is usually shortcrust pastry; the filling may be sweet or savoury, 
though modern tarts are usually fruit-based, sometimes with custard. 
Tartlet refers to a miniature tart; an example would be egg tarts. 
The categories of "tart", "flan", "quiche", and "pie" overlap, with no sharp distinctions.

or with thicker fillings based on eggs and dairy (as in custard pie and cream pie). 
Savoury pies may be filled with meat (as in a steak pie or a Jamaican patty), eggs and cheese (quiche) 
or a mixture of meat and vegetables (pot pie).

Pudding is a type of food that can be either a dessert or a savoury (salty or spicy) dish that is part of the main meal.


In the United States and Canada, pudding characteristically denotes a sweet, 
milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards, instant custards or a mousse, 
often commercially set using cornstarch, gelatin or similar coagulating agent such as Jell-O.
